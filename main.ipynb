       "[['Onychonycteris finneyi, the earliest known bat, already possessed powered flight. O. finneyi likely had an undulating flight style that alternated periods of fluttering with gliding. Evidence for this lies in the broad and short nature of O. finneyi wing morphology, which would have made it difficult to efficiently maneuver in the air or sustain flight. Additionally claws were seen on the ends of their forelimb digits (which have since disappeared in modern day bats) giving evidence that O. finneyi was a skilled climber. The common ancestor of all bats is hypothesized to have been an arboreal quadruped of the northern hemisphere. This ancestor is predicted to have lived 64 million years ago at the border of the Cretaceous and Paleogene, based on molecular and paleontological data. There is a gap in the fossil record, and no transitional fossils exist from this quadrupedal ancestor to the appearance of the modern bat.',\n",
       "  'It is, of course, one of the most notable things about bats: they can fly. To do this, they have wings. Wings that are composed of a double membrane stretched, over a framework of finger bones. See bat anatomy for more on wing structure. Well, flight is a fascinating thing. In the human mind it symbolizes freedom and it is quite likely that it first evolved – via gliding – as an escape mechanism. If you are in a tree and an enemy is behind you – and you can safely jump out of the tree and he can’t – you are definitely on a winner.',\n",
       "  'They can fold their wings, the way we can move our fingers! They can fold them into different shapes and change directions very quickly. They can also apply sudden brakes. Bats have strong muscles in their backs and chest. Some of these muscles pull the wings up in an “up-stroke” and some of these bring them down during “down-stroke“. Bats fold their wings while they are making an “up-stroke”. This reduces the opposition from the air (Air Resistance) and they save their effort.'],\n",

Even before the siege of Saguntum had concluded,Hannibal had set things in motion.Having sent a number of embassies to the Gallic tribes in the Po valley with the mission of establishing a safe place for Hannibal to debouch from the Alps into the Po valley. He did not desire to cross this rugged mountain chain and to descend into the Po valley with exhausted troops only to have to fight a battle.Additionally the fierce gauls would provide a source of manpower for Hannibal's army.The romans had recently conquered much territory from the gauls in this area,brutally subjagating them ,seizing their land and redistributing it to roman colonists.Thus securing an alliance proved to be easy. After the sack of Saguntum he dismissed his troops to their own localities. He did this with the hope of cultivating the best possible morale in his army for the upcoming campaign, which he knew was going to be difficult. He left his brother,Hasdrubal in charge of the administration of Carthaginian Iberia, as well as its defense against the Romans. In addition to this, he swapped the native troops of Iberia to Africa, and the native troops of Africa to Iberia.\",\n",
